1. Let's create a 'DELETE ALL TASKS' button, and place it above the filter buttons.
Clicking the button removes all tasks.

2. Let's create a fourth filter button-if you click it, the first three tasks will be displayed.

3. Relocate everything associated with  filters to the Todolist.tsx component. Make it work.
